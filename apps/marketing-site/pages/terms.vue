              Authorized Users' use of the Services (collectively, "User Data").
              Although we perform regular backups of User Data, You are solely
              responsible for all User Data that You transmit or that relates to
              any activity You have undertaken using the Services. To the extent

              corruption of any such User Data, and You hereby waive any right

              request, made available to Subscriber within a commercially
              reasonable timeframe. After the Retention Period, such User Data
              may be permanently deleted from our servers and unrecoverable by
              You or Subscriber. After the Retention Period, we make no
              representations or warranties as to the preservation or integrity
              of User Data. You hereby agree that we shall have no obligation to
              retain User Data after the Retention Period, unless otherwise
              prohibited by law. If Subscriber renews its subscription prior to
              the end of the Retention Period, User Data shall remain available
              to You and Subscriber.
