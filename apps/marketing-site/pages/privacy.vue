              Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of
              State that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a
              verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
              You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your
              minor child.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal
              information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make
              the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
              Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to
              create an account with us. We will only use personal information
              provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
              requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
            </p>

              We will respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of
              its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will
              inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will
              deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your
              option.

              You may designate an authorized agent to make a request under the
              CCPA on your behalf. To do so, you must provide the authorized
              agent written permission to do so, and we may require you to
              verify your identity directly with us. Alternatively, an
              authorized agent that has been provided power of attorney pursuant
              to Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465 may make a request on your
              behalf.
